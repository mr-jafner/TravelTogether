# TravelTogether - Development Backlog

*Updated: 2025-09-03*  
*Format: Task backlog with detailed implementation plans in /ref/plans/*

## ðŸš¨ **Priority Tasks**

### 1. **User-Contextualized Trip Experience** - HIGH PRIORITY  
**Problem**: Username system is identity-only - need to make UserContext meaningful for trip access and personalization  
**Dependencies**: âœ… Global Username System (deployed), âœ… Participant Autocomplete System (deployed)  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 sessions  
**Key Features**: Filter trips by user participation, user-specific ratings, permission restrictions (only edit your trips), personalized dashboard  
**Technical Scope**: Integrate `username` with trip filtering, rating system updates, permission middleware, user-specific data views  
**Critical Next Step**: This transforms the username system from identity-only to fully functional user experience  
**Foundation Ready**: Consistent participant naming now established via autocomplete system

### 2. **Home Dashboard Enhancement** - MEDIUM PRIORITY  
**Problem**: Dashboard functionality can be enhanced beyond current MVP  
**Plan**: See `/ref/plans/dashboard/TravelTogether_Dashboard_MVP_Summary.md` for additional features
