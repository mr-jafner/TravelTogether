**Status**: ✅ Fully Implemented, Tested, and Deployed to Production

### ✅ **Rating System Persistence Bug Fix** - COMPLETED 2025-08-28
**Problem**: Rating system was zeroing out after user clicks - ratings would not persist and would reset to 0/5 after any interaction

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Callback signature mismatch in ActivityRating and RestaurantRating components
- Components were passing `(activityId, newRatings)` but parent expected just `(newRatings)`
- This caused `activityId` to be interpreted as the ratings object, breaking state updates
- TripDetail was initializing with simplified vote count objects instead of full participant rating data

**Implementation Summary**:
- Fixed callback signatures in both rating components to pass `onRatingChange(newRatings)` instead of `onRatingChange(activityId, newRatings)`
- Updated TripDetail to fetch actual participant ratings from API instead of using simplified vote counts
- Enhanced API service with rating object transformation from array to object format
- Added proper rating state initialization with real participant data structure

**Files Created/Modified**:
- MODIFIED: `travel-together-frontend/src/components/ActivityRating.jsx` - Fixed callback signature
- MODIFIED: `travel-together-frontend/src/components/RestaurantRating.jsx` - Fixed callback signature  
- MODIFIED: `travel-together-frontend/src/components/TripDetail.jsx` - Enhanced rating state management and API integration
- MODIFIED: `travel-together-frontend/src/services/api.js` - Added rating object transformation utilities

**Key Technical Fixes**:
- **Callback Pattern**: `onRatingChange(newRatings)` - correct single parameter
- **State Structure**: `{[participant]: rating}` format for all rating state
- **API Integration**: Proper fetching and transformation of participant ratings
- **Data Flow**: Consistent rating data structure throughout component tree

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ Ratings now persist after clicks
- ✅ Multiple participants can rate independently  
- ✅ Average calculations work correctly
- ✅ API calls successfully save ratings to backend
- ✅ Rating display updates properly in real-time

**Git Workflow**: Followed proper feature branch workflow (`fix/rating-system-persistence`)

**Status**: ✅ Fully Implemented, Tested, and Deployed to Production

### ✅ **Travel, Lodging, Logistics CRUD Implementation** - COMPLETED 2025-08-29
**Problem**: Complete CRUD functionality needed for Travel, Lodging, and Logistics tabs with proper edit/delete capabilities and dynamic tab counters

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Backend getTripById() method wasn't including travel, lodging, logistics data arrays
- Frontend tab counters were hardcoded to 0 instead of using dynamic data
- Edit buttons existed but missing conditional rendering for edit forms

### ✅ **Production Backend Deployment & API Routing Fix** - COMPLETED 2025-08-29
**Problem**: Backend deployment interrupted during previous session, production server missing latest API routes for frontend integration

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Local backend had `/traveltogether/api/` routes but production server was missing them
- Frontend was configured to call `https://jafner.com/traveltogether/api/trips` but production returned 404
- Health endpoint `/traveltogether/api/health` was missing from production deployment
- PM2 service needed restart with updated server configuration

**Implementation Summary**:
- Successfully deployed latest backend code to production server using SSH deployment workflow
- Added missing `/traveltogether/api/` route prefixes for frontend served from `/traveltogether/` path
- Implemented proper health check endpoint at `/traveltogether/api/health`
- Followed proper deployment procedures: stop PM2 → update files → test syntax → restart PM2
- Verified full API functionality with production endpoint testing

**Files Created/Modified**:
- MODIFIED: `/var/www/traveltogether-backend/server.js` on production - Added `/traveltogether/api/` routes

- ✅ Backend PM2 service running stable with no errors
- ✅ Frontend API integration fully functional
- ✅ Git repository updated with all local changes committed and pushed

**Lessons Learned - API Routing**:
- Frontend served from `/traveltogether/` requires matching API routes `/traveltogether/api/`
- Health check endpoints should match frontend API call patterns
- Production deployments require careful route testing after file updates
- SSH deployment workflow: always backup → update → test syntax → restart service
- PM2 logs help identify routing issues: `pm2 logs [service-name] --lines N`

**Git Workflow**: Direct commits of production configuration updates
**Final Commit**: `Update production API configuration and fix frontend API calls`

**Status**: ✅ Fully Deployed to Production - Complete Integration Success

### ✅ **Dashboard Date Display & SPA Routing Fixes** - COMPLETED 2025-08-29
**Problem**: Dashboard trip cards showed "No date yet" instead of actual dates, and SPA direct URLs returned 404 errors

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- **Dashboard**: Frontend expected `start_date`/`end_date` but API returns `startDate`/`endDate` (camelCase vs snake_case mismatch)
- **SPA Routing**: Complex regex pattern `(?!assets)` in httpd.conf was invalid for OpenBSD httpd, causing 404s on direct URL access

**Implementation Summary**:
- **Frontend Fix**: Updated `transformTripData()` in HomeDashboard.jsx to use correct API field names
- **Server Fix**: Simplified httpd.conf regex from `/traveltogether/(?!assets).*` to `/traveltogether/.*`
- **No backend changes required** - API was already returning correct data format

**Files Created/Modified**:
- MODIFIED: `travel-together-frontend/src/features/dashboard/HomeDashboard.jsx` - Fixed field name mapping
- MODIFIED: `/etc/httpd.conf` on production server - Simplified regex pattern for SPA routing

**Key Technical Implementations**:

- ✅ Dashboard cards now show proper dates: "1 days away", "Trip starts 8/30/2025"
- ✅ SPA routing works: `https://jafner.com/traveltogether/trips/123` returns 200 (not 404)
- ✅ Local development testing confirmed both fixes working
- ✅ Frontend build successful, no breaking changes
- ✅ Production deployment ready via FreeFileSync

**Git Workflow**: Feature branch `fix/dashboard-dates-and-spa-routing` merged to main
**Final Commit**: `Fix dashboard trip cards date display and SPA routing`

**Status**: ✅ Fully Implemented and Tested - Ready for Production Deployment

### ✅ **MIME Type Crisis Resolution & Final Dashboard/SPA Deployment** - COMPLETED 2025-08-29
**Problem**: Production deployment caused MIME type errors preventing JavaScript/CSS from loading properly

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- **Initial MIME Crisis**: httpd.conf SPA rewrite rule `/traveltogether/.*` was too broad and caught asset files
- **Assets serving as HTML**: CSS and JS files returned `Content-Type: text/html` instead of proper MIME types
- **Browser Caching**: Old HTML responses were cached even after server-side fixes

**Implementation Summary**:
- **Server Configuration**: Fixed httpd.conf to properly handle assets vs SPA routing
- **MIME Type Resolution**: Assets now serve with correct `text/css` and `application/javascript` MIME types  
- **Browser Cache Issue**: Resolved with hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) to clear cached HTML responses
- **Dashboard Date Fix**: Successfully deployed - trip cards now show actual dates and calculations
- **Production Verification**: All features working correctly on live site

**Files Created/Modified**:
- MODIFIED: `/etc/httpd.conf` on production server - Multiple attempts to fix SPA routing vs assets
- CREATED: `ref/urgent-mime-type-fix.md` - Emergency documentation for session continuity
